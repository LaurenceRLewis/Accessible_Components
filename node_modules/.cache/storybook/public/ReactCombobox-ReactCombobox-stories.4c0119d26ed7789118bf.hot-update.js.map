Future enhancement\n- When the input field is empty, the list of options is hidden.\n\n## Autocomplete Models\nThe autocomplete model can be either \"list\", \"both\", or \"none\". Here is what each of these modes means:\n- **List**: This mode provides an autocomplete behavior where the textbox populates suggestions as the user types, and allows the user to select one from a list. The list of suggestions is updated dynamically as the user types, and it is hidden when the input field is empty.\n- **Both and None will be added as examples in the future**\n\n## Accessibility\nThe **ReactCombobox** component uses the \\`ariaAnnounce\\` function for accessibility. This function dynamically creates an accessible live region announcement that is read by screen readers, ensuring important updates or notifications are communicated to all users, regardless of their accessibility needs.\n\nThis component announces the number of options in the list box when it is expanded to the screen reader user. The number is visible on screen and located below the help text in the format \"x of y results\".\n\nThe \\`ariaAnnounce\\` function is part of the open-source project [aria-announce](https://github.com/WhatSock/aria-announce), which provides utilities for managing live region announcements in web applications.\n\n**Usage:**\n\\`\\`\\`jsx\nimport ReactCombobox from './ReactCombobox';\n\n<ReactCombobox autocomplete=\"list\" />\n\\`\\`\\`\n`;\n\nexport default description;"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
