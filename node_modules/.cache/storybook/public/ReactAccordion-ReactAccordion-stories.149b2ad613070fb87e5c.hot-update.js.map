It allows users to show and hide sections of content.\n\nEach Accordion item consists of two parts: \n\n- The accordion header, which includes a title and an icon indicating the expansion state. When a user interacts with the header, either through a mouse click or keyboard controls, it toggles the expansion state. \n\n- The accordion content, which is displayed when the accordion header is expanded. The content can be any type of HTML content.\n\nThe Accordion component supports both single and multiple active items. This means you can configure it to either allow multiple content sections to be open at once, or to ensure that only one section is open at a time.\n\nYou can customize the icon used in the accordion headers by passing a React component to the \\`CustomIcon\\` prop. This component will receive an \\`active\\` prop, which is a boolean representing whether the accordion item is currently expanded. If the \\`CustomIcon\\` prop is not provided, default Chevron icons will be used.\n\nAdding a named region to the Accordion provides the advantage of organizing and categorizing the accordion items into distinct groups. By assigning a groupName to the Accordion, you can have multiple Accordions on the same page, each with its own set of items. This can be particularly useful when you have different sections of content that need to be independently expandable and collapsible.\n\nThe Accordion uses WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties to ensure it is accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies. It supports all the necessary keyboard interactions as recommended by the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, such as Arrow, Home, and End keys.\n\nLearn more about the component and its properties at the Aria Practices Guide [Accordion Pattern (Sections With Show/Hide Functionality)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/).\n\n## Usage\n\n\\`\\`\\`jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Accordion from './ReactAccordion';\n\n// Define your custom icon component\nconst MyIcon = ({ active }) => {\n  const color = active ?
