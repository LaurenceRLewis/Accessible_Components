# ARIA Announce Live Region Technique Explained

### Function Overview

The `ariaAnnounce` function creates a dynamic **"live region"** in the Document Object Model (DOM). Live regions are used in Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) to make web content more accessible to people who use screen readers.

### Functionality

1. `ariaAnnounce` is a JavaScript function that accepts a `message` parameter, which will be the text to announce.  
2. It first creates a `div` element, setting various CSS properties to make the div effectively invisible on the page.  
3. It then sets three ARIA attributes on this element:
   - `aria-live="assertive"`: The screen reader will interrupt whatever it's doing to read this message.
   - `aria-atomic="true"`: Ensures the entire contents are announced, not just a delta.
   - `role="status"`: Used to present status/log information; polite by default, but overridden here.
4. This `div` is then appended to the body of the document.  
5. After a brief delay (50ms), the message is set as the `innerText` of the div, triggering the announcement.  
6. After 7 seconds (7000ms), the `div` is removed from the DOM.

### Usage

You can use this function to make important announcements that wouldnâ€™t otherwise be detected by screen readers, such as AJAX success messages or UI state changes.

Example:

```js
ariaAnnounce('Form submitted successfully');
