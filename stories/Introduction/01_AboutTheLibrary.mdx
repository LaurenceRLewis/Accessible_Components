# Welcome to Accessible Components

This project is a set of REACT components designed with accessibility in mind, adhering to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Specification (1.2).

A semantic HTML first approach is used to create the core functionality and structure of the components.

ARIA is used to support gaps in HTML and browsers enhancing accessibility for individuals with disabilities and improving compatibility with assistive technologies.

The default Control settings are the recommended setting for each component with additional Controls for testing purposes.

The components shouldn't be used in production without comprehensive testing first. This library serves as a space for experimenting with various techniques to determine support for specific functionalities, roles, and attributes. The props (controls) offered on some components are for testing variations in builds to identify the most effective user experience.

All components are developed by Laurence Lewis.
