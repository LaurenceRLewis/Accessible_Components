## HTML Datalist

HTML Datalist is a simple and native way to add autocomplete functionality to an input field. It uses the \`<datalist>\` element, which works in conjunction with an \`<input>\` to provide a dropdown of options. These options can be static or dynamically generated, and are filtered by the browser as the user types into the input. It's a straightforward solution for simpler use cases.
